Compile: Create bin -> from bin -> javac -d . ../src/*.java
Run : java GameGui

Description:
A simple game of pong.

Features:
	The game has three states: run, pause and gameover.
	Spacebar to pause. Up and Down arrows to move paddle.
	The user may control the ball speed and corresponding paddle speed via the two sliders located at the bottom.	

Future improvements:
	I fully intend to refactor the code in time to address the issue of cohesiveness.
